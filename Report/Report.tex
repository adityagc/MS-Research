	Structured sparsity regularization refers to a class of statistical techniques that extend the sparsity-based regularization methods such as the Lasso\cite{tibshirani1996regression}. Whereas regularization techniques such as the Ridge \cite{hoerl1970ridge} seek to minimize the *insert formula*, which shrinks the coefficients corresponding to *TIKONOV INSERT*, the Lasso induces sparsity in the coefficient vector, setting the deselected coefficients to exactly 0. This has various advantages such as model interpretability, computational efficiency and reduction of dimentionality.
	
	The group lasso was first introduced in 2006 \cite{yuan2006model} as a technique to select groups of predictors.
